### OPS vs API surface (dev discipline)

- `/ops/*` is dev/admin tooling only (internal operators + scripts; not the public surface).
- `/api/*` is the public-ish surface (the contract we treat as “product/API”).
- After every major update, verify/update dev seed + helper scripts (`dev-seed.ps1`, `dev-functions.ps1`, `dev-up.ps1`) and record it here + in the master plan (stay prod-like).
